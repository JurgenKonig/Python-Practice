# Python-Practice
This is a working collection of Python files as I try and learn the language better. All code written within a WSL Kali Linux shell, utilizing Nano and the Python3 package within Bash. 

Programs Written:

1. characterInput - BEGINNER level file. Very barebones file that simply asks the user for several inputs: their name, age, and how many times they want the ensuing messages to be printed out. The program takes in these inputs, and prints back out to the user their name and age, as well as calculating how long it'll be until they turn 100 years old. 
2. evenOrOdd - BEGINNER level file. Another barebones file that simply asks for a user input to determine if it's even or odd. After the program prints out the approriate message, it then prompts the user for another number. The program then checks if the second number divides evenly into the first number, and then prints out the message that matches the condition.
3. fibonaccisSequence - BEGINNER level file. This program creates a list object, and then uses a simple for loop as well as if statements to accurately recreate Fibonacci's sequence (up to the number in the sequence that the user specifies). It then asks the user for a number to compare to the completed list, and then compares each number within the list that is less than the specified number. The program adds these numbers into a second list, and prints out the newly completed list to the user.
